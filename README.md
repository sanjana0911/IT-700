# For this project, our initial step involves installing the XAMPP server, which provides the Apache distribution. Once installation is complete:
# Launch the XAMPP control panel.
# Start both the Apache web server and MySQL database server.
# Proceed to create the necessary database using the MySQL Admin. We can access the phpMyAdmin interface through the admin privileges.
# Write and edit the code using the Sublime Text editor.
# Upon completing the code, execute it on the local server.
